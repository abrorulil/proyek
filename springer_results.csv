10.1007/978-3-032-02936-2_17,Beyond Logs: AI’s Internal Representations as the New Process Evidence,"Traditional process mining relies on symbolic event logs that represent activities as discrete labels, often overlooking the rich contextual and semantic nuances found in real-world data such as textual reports, visual records, or sensor outputs. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift: using the internal representations of AI models—embedding spaces learned from data—as the foundation for process mining. Our framework performs both process discovery and conformance checking directly in these continuous vector spaces, enabling the detection of semantically similar yet lexically divergent events. We evaluate our approach along three dimensions: (i) whether embedding-based discovery maintains or improves accuracy over symbolic baselines, (ii) whether multimodal sources such as video and audio can be processed as unified embeddings for mining purposes, and (iii) whether conformance checking in embedding space enables alignment across noisy or semantically perturbed traces. By treating AI’s internal representations as a novel form of process evidence, we show how process mining can move beyond traditional logs and unlock deeper, semantically enriched interpretations of real-world workflows.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-02936-2_17

Machine learning models, including Linear Regression (LR), Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), and Huber Regressor (HR), were employed to develop a predictive framework for PF optimization. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as R^2 (0.9829 for LR, 0.9827 for RANSAC, and 0.9824 for HR), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), demonstrating their high predictive accuracy. The findings highlight the capability of machine learning to improve blasting control, reduce environmental impacts, and promote sustainable mining practices. By integrating artificial intelligence into mining operations, this study advances the concept of intelligent mining, offering innovative solutions that enhance operational efficiency while fostering environmental stewardship.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-00983-8_6

Branching the activation (source) or the target of the constraints, that is, allowing more than one event type to appear as the source or the target, is a typical way to increase their expressivity. For the discovery of Declare constraints, only the case of branching the constraint target considering the inclusive disjunction policy has been considered. In this paper, we present CBDeclare , a comprehensive approach to branched declarative process constraints, contributing in two key dimensions. First, we define a semantics of both source- and target-branched Declare constraints considering different branching policies. Second, we devise methods to discover the newly defined Declare constraint types from an event log. Our solution leverages the SIESTA framework’s scalable and incremental infrastructure for event processing, achieving significant performance gains in mining these extended constraint when compared to the solutions for target-branched constraint discovery available in the literature.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-02929-4_9
10.1007/978-3-032-02867-9_5,MANTA: Materializing Views on Event Data for Context Exploration in Process Analysis,"Process analysis relies on views on event data composed of contexts that group events, e.g., as induced by a case notion, and a relation between events, such as ‘directly-follows’. Together, they cluster and structure events into classical traces or, recently, into object-centric executions or actor routines. Contexts are selected to cater to a specific analysis question. Yet, when dealing with a new process or a new analysis question, an analyst has to explore different context definitions. Materializing all resulting views results in unnecessary overhead, not only in computation and storage, but also in analysis complexity and data redundancy. In this paper, we study the construction of views on event data in an exploratory setting by introducing the notion of a context in event data and its induced view on the data. Based thereon, we define the problem of view materialization to find contexts that adequately represent the data from different perspectives. These views provide an analyst an overview of the data and enable exploratory analysis beyond preconceived case notions. We instantiate the problem for object-centric contexts and address it drawing on strategies for subset selection. We show the feasibility using experiments with synthetic and real-world event data.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-02867-9_5

We study the complete pattern mining problem for Simon’s congruence, where the problem is to find the substrings of a given text  $$\texttt{T}$$ T that maximizes the number of congruent substrings of the text, for each possible value of k . We design new data structures that capture the equivalence classes with respect to $$\sim _k$$ ∼ k for substrings of the text. We then propose an $$O(|\texttt{T}|^2\log ^2|\texttt{T}|)$$ O ( | T | 2 log 2 | T | ) -time algorithm for fixed-sized alphabets using the new data structures.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-01475-7_13

However, many PM projects fail and some organizations are much better at using PM than others. In this paper, we tackle the issue of understanding what can hinder process mining effectiveness in an organization through the theoretical lens of contingency theory. Contingency variables are defined as organization-specific attributes that might affect process mining results. To distinguish our work from the study of process mining critical success factors, we focus on negative contingencies for PM. We first derive an initial list of negative contingencies for process mining initiatives by running a sentiment analysis on process mining case studies. Then, we validate our findings in interviews with process mining practitioners. The interviews show a substantial agreement among practitioners on the identified negative contingencies. At the same time, they provide additional insights on how to manage the risk associated with the contingencies materialization.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-02867-9_30
10.1007/978-3-032-02867-9_26,Discovering Multivariate Conditional Rules Through Automatic Reasoning-Enhanced Feature Generation for Process Outcome Explanation,"Undesired process outcomes might manifest in subtle ways, particularly when their underlying causes are not explicitly known or documented. So far, the detection of these causes has been limited, especially if they refer to complex dependencies across multiple data attributes and within trace clusters. Hence, in this paper, we propose the multi-level method PROXEE to detect rules that explain undesired outcomes. The method integrates unstructured textual information such as handbooks and regulatory documents via a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline combined with large language model (LLM) reasoning, as well as structured process data enriched with contextual statistical analysis. We identify contextual trace clusters and automatically generate enhanced features. They are subsequently analyzed in conjunction with the textual knowledge to discover natural language based rules with varying degrees of complexity, ranging from rules found in documents to rules inferred exclusively from data and conceptual understanding. We evaluate PROXEE using two case studies and compare the results with CART decision tree, DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1, and OpenAI DataAnalyst. Our findings demonstrate that PROXEE yields concise explanations for undesired outcomes and outperforms existing methods.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-02867-9_26
10.1007/978-981-96-2771-4_1,Research on Vulnerability Mining Technology of Electric Power Industrial Control Equipment Based on Genetic Algorithm,"The traditional vulnerability mining methods for information systems require prior knowledge of protocol specifications, which often necessitates developers to invest significant time in learning and comprehending the protocol format for effective development of vulnerability mining test cases. However, in the power industry, industrial control equipment utilizes a multitude of private protocols with undisclosed specifications (unknown protocols). Consequently, the conventional vulnerability mining technology based on prior knowledge cannot be directly applied to these unknown industrial control protocols. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method and system of fuzzy testing for industrial control equipment based on genetic algorithms. The objective is to resolve challenges such as prolonged development periods, inability to test unknown protocols, and low efficiency in conducting vulnerability mining tests on unknown protocol vulnerabilities within industrial control equipment.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-96-2771-4_1
10.1007/978-3-031-98287-3_31,Enhancing Cellular Line Representation with Transformer-Based Text Embeddings for Precision Drug Repositioning,"This paper presents a novel approach to the computational representation of cellular lines using transformer-based embeddings. By leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, we generate context-aware embeddings from biomedical literature from the PubMed database, offering a more nuanced and biologically relevant representation of cellular lines compared to traditional methods like TF-IDF and SVDD. We applied these embeddings to cluster cellular lines, using the elbow method to identify a set of distinct clusters that reflect biologically meaningful relationships. To evaluate the quality of these clusters, we employed the Topic Coherence metric, achieving a coherence score of 0.395, indicative of moderate consistency across clusters. The results demonstrate the potential of transformer-based models to improve drug discovery by identifying shared characteristics between cellular lines, enabling more accurate drug response predictions and advancing personalized medicine. This method offers an interesting improvement in the precision of cellular line modeling, paving the way for more efficient drug repositioning and targeted therapies in cancer research.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-98287-3_31
